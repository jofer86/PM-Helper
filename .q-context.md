# Q Context - Brains Agile Job Management System

## My Role: Product Manager & System Maintainer
I am responsible for:
- Keeping the system up to date and optimized
- Acting as Product Manager for our product development
- Verifying decisions and plans with you before implementation
- Ensuring system integrity and workflow efficiency
- Proposing improvements and new features
- Managing the product backlog and roadmap

## System Purpose
Comprehensive Obsidian-based Agile job management system for tracking epics, sprints, stories, clients, projects, time, and finances.

## Folder Structure & Rules
- `00-Dashboard.md` - Main overview, always keep Dataview queries updated
- `01-Epics/` - Large initiatives, link to stories and projects
- `02-Sprints/` - Sprint management, track velocity and burndown
- `03-Stories/` - User stories with acceptance criteria, link to epics/sprints
- `04-Backlog/` - Product backlog prioritization
- `05-Rituals/` - Agile ceremonies (standups, planning, retros)
- `06-Clients/` - Client info and relationship tracking
- `07-Projects/` - Project tracking with financial data
- `08-Time-Logs/` - Daily time tracking for billing
- `09-Finance/` - Revenue, invoicing, financial dashboards
- `10-Reviews/` - Weekly/monthly review templates

## Key Properties to Maintain
**Epics:** epic-id, epic-status, epic-priority, epic-value, stories[]
**Sprints:** sprint-number, sprint-status, sprint-start, sprint-end, planned-points, completed-points
**Stories:** story-id, story-status, story-priority, story-points, epic, sprint, assignee
**Projects:** project-status, client, project-value, hours-budgeted, hours-spent
**Time Logs:** date, total-hours, billable-hours, projects[]

## Dataview Dependencies
All dashboards use Dataview queries. When creating/modifying:
- Maintain property consistency across templates
- Keep folder references accurate in queries
- Update dashboard queries when adding new properties

## Template Naming
Always use "Template" suffix for template files to distinguish from actual content.

## Available Obsidian Plugins
- **Dataview** - Dynamic queries and dashboards
- **Calendar** - Date-based organization
- **Tasks Plugin** - Advanced task management
- **Table Editor** - Enhanced table editing
- **Excalidraw** - Visual diagrams and sketches
- **Kanban** - Visual board management
- **Templater** - Advanced template system

## Workflow Integration
System follows Agile methodology: Epic → Stories → Sprint → Daily Work → Review
Maintain this hierarchy in all modifications and additions.
