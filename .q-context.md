## Key Properties to Maintain
**Epics:** epic-id, epic-status, epic-priority, epic-value, stories[]
**Sprints:** sprint-number, sprint-status, sprint-start, sprint-end, planned-points, completed-points
**Stories:** story-id, story-status, story-priority, story-points, epic, sprint, assignee
**Projects:** project-status, client, project-value, hours-budgeted, hours-spent
**Time Logs:** date, total-hours, billable-hours, projects[]

## Dataview Dependencies
All dashboards use Dataview queries. When creating/modifying:
- Maintain property consistency across templates
- Keep folder references accurate in queries
- Update dashboard queries when adding new properties

## Template Naming
Always use "Template" suffix for template files to distinguish from actual content.

## Available Obsidian Plugins
- **Dataview** - Dynamic queries and dashboards
- **Calendar** - Date-based organization
- **Tasks Plugin** - Advanced task management
- **Table Editor** - Enhanced table editing
- **Excalidraw** - Visual diagrams and sketches
- **Kanban** - Visual board management
- **Templater** - Advanced template system

## Workflow Integration
System follows Agile methodology: Epic → Stories → Sprint → Daily Work → Review
Maintain this hierarchy in all modifications and additions.
