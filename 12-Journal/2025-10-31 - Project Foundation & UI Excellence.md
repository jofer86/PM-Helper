## 🎯 Key Decisions & Rationale

### **1. Rails for Speed** ✅

**Rationale**: Parent trust essential for sports team management platform  
**Impact**: Professional appearance builds confidence from day one

### **3. Mexican Market Focus** ✅
**Decision**: Target amateur sports teams in Mexico specifically  
**Rationale**: Underserved market with limited local competition  
**Impact**: Clear geographic and cultural focus for product-market fit

### **4. Rem-Based Design System** ✅
**Decision**: Use rem units instead of px for all spacing  
**Rationale**: Better accessibility and responsive scaling  
**Impact**: Professional, accessible interface that respects user preferences
